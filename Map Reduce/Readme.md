javac -classpath $HADOOP_CLASSPATH -d avg_classes AverageAge.java
jar -cvf avg_age.jar -C avg_classes/ .

# Upload the input file to HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/root/mimic
hdfs dfs -put /root/Patients.csv /user/root/mimic/

# Run the MapReduce job
hadoop jar avg_age.jar AverageAge /user/root/mimic/Patients.csv /user/root/output_avg

# View the output
hdfs dfs -cat /user/root/output_avg/part-r-00000
